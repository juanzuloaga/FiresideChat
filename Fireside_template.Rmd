**Welcome to bird model evaluation!**

Below are the model product inputs and outputs for evaluation, divided across six categories. Within, each category there will be several tasks. Note that some categories are in-progress. Please use this Google form <a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xhekH7fj2461LX_AAbN8Md1mLibKmaGo4mF_FexQm3M/edit target="_blank">[MODEL EVALUATION FROM]{style="color:green"}</a> to provide your feedback on each section of the model cycle.

**Model rationale**

The BAM V5 models were produced for the purpose of modelling the distribution and abundance of breeding birds in the boreal forest. The primary purposes of the models are to accurately map the distribution of bird density on the landscape and sum those predictions to estimate population size.

**Description:**

Metadata and preparation for covariates used in model fitting.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
cov_table <- htmltools::tagList(DT::datatable(cov_region_merge,
                                              filter='top',
                                              rownames = F,
                                              escape = F),
                                options = list(pageLength = 3,
                                               autoWidth = TRUE)
                                )
```

Note: Use the slider in the 'Relative importance' column to select covariates with high values.

```{r }
cov_table
```
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### b. Covariate relative importance

**Task:**

Please re-rank covariates and/or suggest expected % relative importance.

**Description:**

Mean relative importance across 10 bootstraps; error bars represent standard error. Definitions for covariate names can be found in task 2a above.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=6}

    ggplot(data=df_bootstrap_merge, aes(x=reorder(var, mean), y=mean, fill=mean))+
               geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill="gray") + 
       labs(title = "Covariates relative importance",
            x = "Covariates", y = "%")+
      coord_flip()+
        theme(legend.position = "none")+
      geom_errorbar(
        aes(ymin = mean - se, ymax = mean + se), 
        position = position_dodge2(padding = 0.5))
```

## 3.DATA PREPARATION

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### a. Sampling data

**Task:**

Please identify any sampling data preparation steps that might violate assumptions and suggest alternatives.

**Description:**

The following treatments were applied to the survey data

-   Survey data were spatially thinned using a hexagonal grid with cells of 2.5 km spacing to ensure independence of samples. One survey per grid per year was used for each separate model run.

-   Survey data were assigned to bird conservation region (BCR) for each modelling unit using all surveys within the BCR and a 100 km buffer around the BCR.
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### b. Covariate data

**Task:**

Please identify any covariate data preparation steps that might violate assumptions and suggest alternatives.

**Description:**

The following preparations were made to the covariate data:

-   Local covariates were extracted with a 200m buffer radius. Landscape covariates were extracted with a 2 km buffer radius.

-   Covariates were thinned for each BCR using stepwise variance inflation factor (VIF) with a threshold of 10 to reduce covariance, which typically results in no two-way correlation greater than 0.7.

-   Additional preparations are listed in the table in task 2a.

## 4.MODEL FITTING

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### a. Model process

**Task:**

Please identify any modelling choices that might violate assumptions and suggest alternatives.

**Description:**

Separate models were fit for each combination of species and BCR. All models were fit with boosted regression trees that could accommodate up to 3-way interactions between variables. The modelling process consisted with the following steps:

1.  Tuning: models were fit with decreasing learning rates until a reasonable number of trees was found (between 1,000 and 10,000). Covariates with less than 0.1% variable importance were removed.

2.  Bootstrapping: ten models with different selections of spatial thinning were fit using the learning rate and number of trees defined in step 1.

3.  Predicting: predictions were made using covariate values for every 5 years from 1985 to 2020 from the bootstrapped models to 1km resolution.

4.  Validating: values were extracted for withheld data from the prediction surfaces of the closest year and model performance was evaluated for various parameters

5.  Range limiting: predictions outside of probable range based on eBird detections were masked out.

## 5.PREDICTIONS

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### a. Mean density map

**Task:**

Please identify areas that are too high or too low density, if any.

**Description:**

Select "Prediction" on the map below. It shows the mean estimates of the number of male birds per hectare across 10 bootstraps.
:::

## 6.UNCERTAINTY

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### a. Coefficient of variation

**Task:**

Please identify areas that have surprisingly high or low uncertainty, if any.

**Description:**

Select "Uncertainty" on the map below. It shows the coefficient of variation of the number of male birds per hectare across 10 bootstraps.
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### b. Extrapolation map

**Task:**

Please identify any areas that where you are surprised the predictions are or are not extrapolated.

**Description:**

Select "Extrapolation" on the map below. It shows the proportion of bootstraps where the values for at least 1 variable in the model were outside the values in the model, and therefore may not represent the actual relationship between bird density and that variable.
