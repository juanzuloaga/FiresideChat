## FiresideChat

Dear Evaluator, we would your feedback on Species Distribution Models (SDMs) inputs and outputs for several species in Ontario (see list below).

## Species for Evaluation

This website provides information about the SPECIES (see list below) and EXPECTED FEEDBACK (you can provide your feedback using this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17lQl2bk7XmVAIaGmPszP07rHPgKHJkAihRo_HyM_MC0/edit?gid=0#gid=0)).

Please select species you want to provide feedback.........

## Context

Our aim is to develop and interactive and quantitative tool for improving SDMs and evaluating information needs for multiple applications. This tool will foster collaboration among multiple partners and users form model improvement and decision making (see roles below).

### 1 & 3. Modelers

Modelers design, implement, test and communicate models (in this case Species Distribution Models, SDMs) aimed to predict species potential distribution, habitat suitability, relative density, occupancy, among others.

Modelers can input new models (1) and/or make model adjustments (2) based on EVALUATORS feedback

### 2. Evaluators

Evaluators review part of the entire model and provide feedback to modelers.

Evaluators can revisit models to evaluate improvements made by modelers.

Multiple evaluators are allowed in the process.

Evaluators usually are taxonomic experts that know the biology/ecology and the geographic context of the species. However, other modelers and statisticians can play this role by providing feedback on specific aspect of the models (e.g., algorithms to use, evaluate statistical assumptions).

### 4. Resource managers

Resource managers evaluate information needs for multiple applications.

They provide feedback to modelers.

They use these models to inform planning , management, and policy.
